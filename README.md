# dotfiles
My own personal ðŸ’» dotfiles for Linux

*Beware all who enter here*

This repo is mostly filled with junk. Scripts old and long forgotten, serving no purpose to anyone anymore. I havn't had the time to clean it out so its kinda chilling here. Theres i3, fvwm, vim, zsh, and even fish so theres something for everyone to enjoy here!

But right now the only real important part is the terminal URL for the install script so I can install just the files I need on more computers. :)

`curl -L https://git.io/v9u43 | bash`
